# DCS-Bios-A10C-Counter-Measure-Set-Control-Panel-Part-1
Code that drives HDSP Alpha Numeric Displays by Avago Technologies for DCS World A-10C using DCS Bios Software. 

There is only 1 Part.  I went ahead and put both files in this one depository.  
Together, they will drive two arduino(s) to control the Chaff/Flare Display, the MWS Display, and the Jammer Display on the CMSC Panel on the A-10C.
